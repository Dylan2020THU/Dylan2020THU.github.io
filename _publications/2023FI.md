In this paper, we propose a graphon mean-field control &#40;GMFC&#41; framework that introduces graphon theory to the mean-field paradigm to approximate cooperative heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning &#40;MARL&#41; with nonuniform interactions and heterogeneous reward functions and state transition functions among agents.
