title: "Graphon Mean-Field Control for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023FI
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a graphon mean-field control (GMFC) framework that introduces graphon theory to the
mean-field paradigm to approximate cooperative heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with nonuniform
interactions and heterogeneous reward functions and state transition functions among agents.'
