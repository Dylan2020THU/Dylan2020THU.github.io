title: "Heterogeneous Mean-Field Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Communication Routing Selection in SAGI-Net"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022VTC
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a novel communication routing selection model for the SAGI-Net system and established a heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (HMF-MARL) framework to optimize the communication energy efficiency of this system, where the mean-field theory was introduced to enhance the ability of classic MARL method while still maintaining a relatively low computational complexity.'
