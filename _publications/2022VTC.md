In this work, we represent a novel communication routing selection model for the SAGI-Net system and established a heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (HMF-MARL) framework to optimize the communication energy efficiency of this system, where the mean-field theory was introduced to enhance the ability of classic MARL method while still maintaining a relatively low computational complexity.
