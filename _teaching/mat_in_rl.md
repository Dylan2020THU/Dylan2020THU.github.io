In reinforcement learning, the concept of "unbiased estimation" is ubiquitous. One of the core tasks of RL is to estimate various "expected values" through the samples generated from interactions with the environment. In this class, we will first understand the basic concept of unbiased estimation, and then further compare it through two common methods in RL: the Monte Carlo method (unbiased) and the temporal difference method (biased).
