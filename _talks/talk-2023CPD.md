Presentation Topic: _Cooperative Multi-Type Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Management in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks_


In this talk, a novel comprehensive SAGIN system that encompasses five distinct communication links was introduced. Furthur, we proposed an efficient cooperative multi-type multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CMT-MARL) method to address the resource management issue. The experiment results underscore the potential value and feasibility of future implementation of the SAGIN.
