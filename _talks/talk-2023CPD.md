In this talk, a novel comprehensive SAGIN system that encompasses five distinct communication links was introduced. Furthur, we proposed an efficient cooperative multi-type multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CMT-MARL) method to address the resource management issue. The experiment results underscore the potential value and feasibility of future implementation of the SAGIN.
