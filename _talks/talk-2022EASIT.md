Presentation Topic: _Mean-Field Approximation of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation Problem in Vehicular Networks_


In this presentation, we investigate the joint spectrum and power allocation problem for vehicular networks, and proposed a novel mean-field aided multi-agent reinforcement learning method to decrease the computational complexity in solving such combinatorial optimization problems over wireless communication networks.
