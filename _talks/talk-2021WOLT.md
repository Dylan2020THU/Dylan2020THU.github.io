Presentation Topic: _Markov Decision Process based Resource Allocation in V2X Communication Networks with Poisson Traffic_

![2021WOLT.jpg](/images/2021WOLT.jpg "Talk in the 3rd TBSI-WOLT, 2021")

In this work, the sharing of the spectrum and transmission power in vehicular networks is modeled as a resource allocation problem. In summary, the main contribution of this work are as follows:
1. A Poisson traffic is proposed for testing the efficiency of V2X communication network.
2. A reinforcement learning algorithm based on Markov Chain is designed to maximize the capacity for high bandwidth content delivery and improve the payload delivery reliability.
3. A neural network named Deep Q-Network (DQN) with experience replay is established to improve the performance of Q-learning in reinforcement learning.
