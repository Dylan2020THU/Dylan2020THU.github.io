Bio
======
ZHANG Hengxi received the M.S. degree in data science and information technology from Tsinghua University, China, in 2023. From 2020 to 2023, he concentrated on the research topic of multi-agent system for task planning under the
guidance of Assoc. Prof. [DING Wenbo](https://ssr-group.net/) in [SSR Group](https://ssr-group.net/people.html).

Research Interests
======
The research fields of mine are in the theories and applications of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), game
theory and combinatorial optimization, mainly including:

1. Intelligent multi-agent system (MAS), in which different MARL methods would be implemented to address complex task
   planning problems with dynamics and uncertainties.
2. Game-theoritic MAS, where the interactions between agents or players in an MAS would be considered to study their
   behaviors toward specific scenarios.

Awards
======
1. 2023 Excellent Master Thesis Award of Tsinghua University (2 out of 100)
2. 2023 Excellent Individual Award of SIGS, Tsinghua University (7 out of 5,000)
3. 2022 1st Level University Scholarship Award of Tsinghua University 
4. 2022 1st Place (Only) in Academic Oral Presentation of the 4th Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute Workshop of Learning
Theory 
5. 2021 2nd Level School Scholarship Award of SIGS, Tsinghua University
